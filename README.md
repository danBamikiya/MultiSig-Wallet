## MultiSigWallet

MultiSigWallet is a Solidity smart contract that allows a group of owners to manage a shared wallet with multi-signature functionality. Transactions submitted to the wallet require a certain number of owners to approve them before they can be executed. This helps to increase the security of the wallet by preventing any one owner from unilaterally making transactions.

### Usage

To use the MultiSigWallet contract, you will need to interact with it using a tool such as Remix or a web3-enabled application.

### Creating a MultiSigWallet

To create a new MultiSigWallet contract, you will need to deploy it to the blockchain using a tool such as Remix or Truffle.

When deploying the contract, you will need to specify the following parameters:

- `owners` (array of addresses): The addresses of the owners who will be able to approve transactions.
- `required` (uint): The number of owners required to approve a transaction.

### Submitting a Transaction

To submit a new transaction to the wallet, call the `submit` function on the contract and provide the following parameters:

`to` (address): The address of the recipient of the transaction.

`value` (uint): The amount of ether to send in the transaction.

`data` (bytes): Any additional data to include in the transaction.

#### Approving a Transaction

To approve a pending transaction, call the `approve` function on the contract and provide the following parameter:

- `txId` (uint): The ID of the transaction to approve.

### Executing a Transaction

Once a transaction has been approved by the required number of owners, it can be executed by calling the `execute` function on the contract and providing the following parameter:

- `txId` (uint): The ID of the transaction to execute.

### Revoking Approval for a Transaction

If an owner has previously approved a transaction but wishes to revoke their approval, they can do so by calling the `revoke` function on the contract and providing the following parameter:

- `txId` (uint): The ID of the transaction to revoke approval for.
